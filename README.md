Hello, I'm Graham. I am a Computer Science major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a passion for developing software. 

### Focus

Although I love both computers and electronics, I tend to focus on the software side. In general, I develop utilities and tools that complement a workflow, full stack web applications, and (occasionally) games. 

### Specs

My primary work machine runs uses Pop!_OS, while my on-the-go Macbook Pro uses macOS 10.15.6. I use a Das Keyboard (Mac edition) with Cherry MX Blue switches, as well as a Apple Extended II keyboard with ALPS salmon switches.

### Fun Facts

- Favorite game: Super Mario 64
- Favorite beverage: Dr. Pepper
- Favorite show: Seinfeld
