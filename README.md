Hello, I'm Graham. I am a Computer Science major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a passion for developing software. 

### Focus

Although I love both computers and electronics, I tend to focus on the software side. In general, I develop utilities and tools that complement a workflow, full stack web applications, and (occasionally) games. 

### Stack

My languages of choice are either Haxe, Javascript / Typescript, or Go. For web applications, I typically use React alongside a Node.js backend with MongoDB. 
When developing games, depending on the scope of the project, I either develop my own tools or use Godot. When it comes to libraries, I always use open source 
projects unless there are no alternatives.

### Specs

My primary work machine runs uses Pop!_OS, while my on-the-go Macbook Pro uses macOS 10.15.6. I use a Das Keyboard (Mac edition) with Cherry MX Blue switches, as well as a Apple Extended II keyboard with ALPS salmon switches.
