Hello, I'm Graham. I am a Computer Science major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a passion for developing software. 

### Focus

Although I love both computers and electronics, I tend to focus on the software side. In general, I develop utilities and tools that complement a workflow, full stack web applications, and (occasionally) games.
