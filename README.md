Hello, I'm Graham. I am a Computer Science major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a passion for developing software. 

### Focus

Although I love both computers and electronics, I tend to focus on the software side. In general, I develop utilities and tools that complement a workflow, full stack web applications, and (occasionally) games. 

### Specs

My primary work machine runs Pop!_OS, while my on-the-go Macbook Pro uses macOS 10.15.6. I currently use a KBD75 keyboard with Zealios v2 62g switches, but I have 
previously used both a Das Keyboard Series S (Cherry MX Blues) as well as an Apple Extended II keyboard (ALPS Salmon.)

### Fun Facts

- Favorite game: Super Mario 64
- Favorite beverage: Dr. Pepper
- Favorite show: Seinfeld
- Favorite switch: Zealios v2
